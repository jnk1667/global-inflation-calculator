### Main Application Pages

- **Homepage (/) - Multi-Measure Inflation Calculator**
  
  **Methodology and Data Sources:**
  
  The calculator aggregates multiple official inflation indices for each currency to provide comprehensive inflation analysis. This multi-measure approach addresses known limitations of single-index calculations.
  
  **United States Dollar (USD) - 7 Official Measures:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) - Bureau of Labor Statistics
  - Core CPI (excluding food and energy) - BLS
  - Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) - BLS, accounts for substitution effects
  - Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) - Bureau of Economic Analysis
  - Core PCE (Federal Reserve's preferred measure) - BEA
  - Producer Price Index (PPI) - BLS, wholesale inflation
  - GDP Deflator - BEA, broadest inflation measure
  
  **British Pound (GBP) - Multiple Official Measures:**
  - Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) - ONS
  - Retail Price Index (RPI) - ONS, traditional measure
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - ONS
  - PPI Output Prices - ONS, producer inflation
  - Services CPI - ONS
  
  **Euro (EUR) - Comprehensive HICP Measures:**
  - Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - Eurostat
  - Core HICP (excluding energy, food, alcohol, tobacco) - Eurostat
  - HICP Services - Eurostat
  - HICP Goods - Eurostat
  - HICP Energy - Eurostat
  - HICP Food - Eurostat
  
  **Canadian Dollar (CAD) - Multiple CPI Measures:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Statistics Canada
  - Core CPI (CPI-trim, CPI-median, CPI-common) - Bank of Canada
  - CPI excluding food and energy - Statistics Canada
  
  **Australian Dollar (AUD) - Comprehensive Measures:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Australian Bureau of Statistics
  - Trimmed Mean CPI - Reserve Bank of Australia's preferred measure
  - Weighted Median CPI - RBA
  - CPI excluding volatile items - ABS
  
  **Swiss Franc (CHF) - Multiple Indices:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Swiss Federal Statistical Office
  - Core CPI (excluding fresh and seasonal products, energy, fuel) - FSO
  - Domestic CPI - FSO
  
  **Japanese Yen (JPY) - Comprehensive Coverage:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Statistics Bureau of Japan
  - Core CPI (excluding fresh food) - SBJ
  - Core-Core CPI (excluding food and energy) - Bank of Japan
  
  **New Zealand Dollar (NZD) - Multiple Measures:**
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Statistics New Zealand
  - CPI excluding food and energy - Stats NZ
  - Tradables and Non-tradables CPI - Stats NZ
  
  **Why Multi-Measure Aggregation Matters:**
  
  Single inflation measures have inherent limitations. CPI alone doesn't capture substitution effects that Chained CPI addresses. Core measures exclude volatile items but miss real costs consumers face. PCE has broader coverage than CPI. PPI shows wholesale inflation before it reaches consumers. GDP Deflator captures economy-wide price changes.
  
  By aggregating multiple official measures, the calculator provides a more complete view of purchasing power changes. This approach is similar to methodologies used by central banks and institutional investors when analyzing inflation trends.
  
  **Aggregation Methodology:**
  - Multiple data points from official government sources
  - Weighted by coverage breadth and central bank preferences
  - Cross-validated against official composite indices
  - Captures inflation across all sectors of the economy
  
  **Data Coverage:**
  - USD: 1913 to present (112+ years)
  - GBP: 1947 to present (78+ years)

### Commodity and Deflationary Asset Data Sources


### Aggregation Methodology Details


### Calculation Formulas

**Basic Inflation Calculator (Multi-Measure):**
- Adjusted Amount = (Original Amount × Aggregated Current Index) ÷ Aggregated Historical Index
- Total Inflation = ((Adjusted Amount - Original Amount) ÷ Original Amount) × 100
- Annual Rate = (Adjusted Amount ÷ Original Amount)^(1/Years) - 1
- Aggregated Index = Weighted average of all available measures for that currency

**Student Loan Calculator:**
- Monthly Payment = P × [r(1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
  - Where P = principal loan amount, r = monthly interest rate, n = number of payments
- Discretionary Income = AGI - (150% × Federal Poverty Guideline for family size)
- IDR Monthly Payment = (Discretionary Income × Plan Percentage) / 12
- Real Payment Value = Nominal Payment ÷ (1 + Cumulative Inflation)
- Inflation Savings = Σ(Nominal Payment - Real Payment Value) over all years
- Real Wage Growth = ((Current Salary ÷ CPI_current) - (Historical Salary ÷ CPI_historical)) ÷ (Historical Salary ÷ CPI_historical) × 100

**Salary Calculator:**
- Real Salary Value = (Current Salary × Base Year Aggregated Index) ÷ Current Year Aggregated Index
- Purchasing Power Change = ((Real Value - Original Salary) ÷ Original Salary) × 100
- Required Salary = (Original Salary × Current Aggregated Index) ÷ Base Year Aggregated Index

**Retirement Calculator:**
- Future Value = Present Value × (1 + Real Return Rate)^Years
- Real Return Rate = ((1 + Nominal Rate) ÷ (1 + Multi-Measure Inflation Rate)) - 1
- Healthcare Adjusted = Base Amount × (1 + Healthcare Inflation)^Years

**Deflation Calculator:**
- Asset Appreciation = ((Current Price - Historical Price) ÷ Historical Price) × 100
- Real Purchasing Power Gain = Asset Appreciation - Multi-Measure Currency Inflation
- Annualized Return = (Current Price ÷ Historical Price)^(1/Years) - 1

## Competitive Positioning

### Methodological Approach

The calculator's primary characteristic is its multi-measure aggregation methodology. By aggregating all available official inflation indices for each currency, the platform addresses known limitations of single-measure calculations and provides a more comprehensive view of purchasing power changes.

### Student Loan Calculator Differentiation

The student loan calculator uniquely combines real-world salary data from BLS and College Scorecard with inflation-adjusted repayment analysis. Unlike basic loan calculators that only show nominal payments, this tool reveals how inflation reduces the real burden of debt over time and whether career wage growth is keeping pace with inflation. The integration of 800+ occupations and 100+ majors with 10-year real wage growth data provides unparalleled career planning insights.

### Historical Data Coverage

With 112+ years of USD data (1913-present) and extensive coverage for all 8 currencies, the platform offers comprehensive historical datasets for inflation analysis. Student loan data includes the latest May 2024 BLS OEWS release and 2024 College Scorecard earnings.

### Institutional-Grade Methodology

The aggregation approach is similar to methodologies used by central banks and institutional investors when analyzing inflation trends for policy decisions and portfolio management. Student loan calculations use official government data sources exclusively.

### Transparency and Documentation

Full documentation of all data sources, calculation methods, and aggregation weights ensures users understand exactly how results are derived. The student loan calculator includes a comprehensive methodology section explaining data sources, formulas, assumptions, and limitations.

This comprehensive financial analysis platform serves as a bridge between complex economic data and practical financial understanding, making institutional-grade inflation analysis and student loan planning accessible to users worldwide while maintaining high standards of data accuracy and transparency through multi-measure aggregation and official government data sources.
