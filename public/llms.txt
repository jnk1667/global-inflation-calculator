### Calculation Formulas

**Basic Inflation Calculator:**
- Adjusted Amount = (Original Amount × Current CPI) ÷ Historical CPI
- Total Inflation = ((Adjusted Amount - Original Amount) ÷ Original Amount) × 100
- Annual Rate = (Adjusted Amount ÷ Original Amount)^(1/Years) - 1

**Salary Calculator:**
- Real Salary Value = (Current Salary × Base Year CPI) ÷ Current Year CPI
- Purchasing Power Change = ((Real Value - Original Salary) ÷ Original Salary) × 100
- Required Salary = (Original Salary × Current CPI) ÷ Base Year CPI

**Retirement Calculator:**
- Future Value = Present Value × (1 + Real Return Rate)^Years
- Real Return Rate = ((1 + Nominal Rate) ÷ (1 + Inflation Rate)) - 1
- Annuity Payment = Principal × (Rate × (1 + Rate)^Years) ÷ ((1 + Rate)^Years - 1)
- Healthcare Adjusted = Base Amount × (1 + Healthcare Inflation)^Years

**Legacy Planner:**
- Generation Wealth = Previous Wealth × (1 + Growth Rate - Inflation Rate)^Years
- Healthcare Erosion = Wealth × Healthcare Inflation Rate × Years
- Real vs Nominal = Nominal Value ÷ (1 + Cumulative Inflation)
- Purchasing Power Loss = (1 - (Real Value ÷ Nominal Value)) × 100
